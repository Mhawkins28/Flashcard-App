            First, good luck with studying and remember, <b>YOU GOT THIS!</b>
            <br><br>
            As you know this exam consists of the MBE, MEE, and the MPT. This app is here to help. The cards consist of terms that you will need to know for all parts of the exam. 
            <ul>
            <li>Flip the cards by clicking on the card itself.</li> 
            <li>If you know the answer, click the Correct Button, the card will leave the deck and it will go to the next card.</li> 
            <li>If you don't know the answer, click the Incorrect Button, the card will go to the next card, and that card will randomly come back around until you get the correct answer.</li> 
            <li>If you don't want to keep a tally, you can also simply click the Skip Button when you want to go to the next card, which keeps that card in rotation as long as you like.</li> 
        </ul>
            You can reshuffle the deck or restart anytime you want by clicking that option at the top of the screen. <br></br> <b>GOOD LUCK!</b>
