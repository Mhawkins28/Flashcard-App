# **Flashcard App built by Megan Hawkins**


## **Description**

This is a flashcard app to assist people with learning and memorizing concepts of a subject, or a set of subjects. In this instance, the app will assist people in learning subjects in law for the NY Bar Exam. This app is designed for the user to flip through cards that are presented on the screen, marking whether the user gets the answer correct or incorrect.

## **Technologies Used**

* Front-end: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript


## **Unsolved Problems:**

I would like to revisit this app and make it possible for users to create new cards and have multiple decks for different subjects. I would also like to add features that will assist the user in the learning process, such as adding charts or pictures, keeping score after reloads or deck switches (giving a percentage of total correct), and allowing the user to switch which side of the card they see first.


Additionally, I would like to create a functionality that fetches more data for the card questions from an API or something similar. I also plan to improve navigation by creating functions to use the keyboard to click through the cards.

## **User Stories:**

### **MVP Goals**

As the user, I want to have a clean, easy to read layout with the flash card as the predominant feature.

As the user, I want each card to contain 1 concept on one side and the definition to that concept on the other side.

As the user, I want to be able to easily flip/toggle a card as many times as I would like with ease. Preferably, I would like to be able to use the keyboard (spacebar) to flip/toggle, along with a mouse click option.

As the user, I want to click a button to indicate whether I got the card correct or incorrect.

As the user, I want to see how many I have gotten correct/incorrect (but it does not have to keep the total after a refresh/reload).

As the user, I want the cards that I mark correct to leave the active deck and have the incorrect cards go back into rotation until marked correct.

As the user, I would like the total to be readjusted once I mark a card correct, after I once marked it incorrect.

As the user, I want to navigate between cards easily, preferably I would like to be able to use keyboard arrow keys, along with a mouse click/button option.

As the user, I want to be notified with a popup that I have completed the deck and given a decision to restart or end the session.
